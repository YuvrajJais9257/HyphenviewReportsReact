# HyphenView

HyphenView is a self-service Business Intelligence & Data Visualization Platform. It empowers businesses to analyze big and disparate datasets and provides the capability to create customizable dashboards and reports. The platform is compatible with both cloud and on-premises deployments.

## Features & Functionality

- **Quick Data Preparation and Analysis**: Prepare and analyze your data within minutes to create stunning data visualizations.
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: HyphenView's architecture allows a single instance to serve multiple tenants, enabling common access users with specific privileges to access shared resources.
- **Self-service Reporting Framework**: Users can create a background and understand the basics of their questions, enabling them to create better queries for data scientists to find specific answers.
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**:
  - PostgreSQL
  - DB2
  - Oracle
  - Vertica
  - MySQL
  - MS SQL Server
- **Drilldown**: Instantly shift from an overview of data to a more detailed and granular view within the same dataset by clicking on a metric in a dashboard or report. This feature allows users to explore specific information in a report from different angles by stepping down from one level of a predefined data hierarchy to the next.
- **Enforced Access Controls**: Role-based access control restricts access based on a person's role within an organization and is a primary method for advanced access control.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Automatically send reports to clients at specified times. You can specify what is to be included, who should receive the report, and how often it will be sent.
- **Dashboard View for Analysis**: Dashboards compile data and visualize trends and occurrences, allowing all users to understand the analytics and the analysis process.

## Uses

1. **Server Monitoring**: HyphenView monitors server details such as CPU usage, data source monitoring, networking, operating system, and more. The details can be displayed in table view or in various pictorial forms including pie charts, donut charts, stacked charts, bar charts, and more.
2. **CCTV Analysis and Visualization**: HyphenView analyzes and visualizes CCTV data. Reports generated by HyphenView can be seen in either table view or pictorial view, providing insights into the working of CCTV cameras.
3. **Single Reporting Platform**: HyphenView creates a unified reporting platform for server data and network data, generating reports in table format for specific time periods.

## Roadmap

Below are a few features that we plan to add in upcoming releases to improve the efficiency and productivity of the application:

- **Elastic Search**: 
  - Data from multiple external compatible RDBMS, NoSQL, Rest API, Log files, CSVs, and JSON sources will be pulled by connectors into Elastic DB. The pulled data will be processed as per requirements and exposed to the frontend using APIs.
- **API Compatibility**:
  - APIs will help ensure the application functions correctly and seamlessly when connecting external data sources. It will be compatible with multiple sources of APIs for data pulling and populating onto the dashboard.
- **Lightweight UI**:
  - As a Single Page Application (SPA) built on top of React technology, it will increase user experience, making the application more interactive and faster. This will include features focusing on using minimal system resources to provide a fast and responsive user experience.
